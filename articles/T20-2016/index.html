<p>Suresh Raina produced an innings of great composure to help India to a thrilling last-ball victory over Australia in the third and final T20 International match. Raina smashed a 25-ball-49, never once appearing flustered, as India chased down a total of 197 at the <span class="caps">SCG</span> to sweep the KFC T20 series 3-0.
<span class="more"></span></p>
<p>The match was not about just a win or a sweet for India. It was full of nail biting moments that kept viewers at the edge of their seat! Each team member did their bit and they did it the&nbsp;best!</p>
<p>Dhawan’s exit only heralded the arrival of Virat Kohli. He and Rohit Sharma continued their golden run in this land, scoring yet another pair of half-centuries. Sharma was out for 52, caught at midwicket off Cameron Boyce. The leg-spinner should have dismissed Raina two balls later, but the wicket-keeper Cameron Bancroft, making his debut here, bungled what ought to have been a simple stumping. Raina was on 0 then. Next ball, he hammered Boyce for&nbsp;six.</p>
<p>The men in blue spelt magic on the grounds! They did not just display a good game for the viewers across the globe, but also stood as a team, decided to win and hit the winning stroke with such ease! A great team, brains to the game, victory in the heart and a mind driven by goal and determination made the victory possible and a&nbsp;reality!</p>
